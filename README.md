# Simple Blog Website

## Notes
1. I spent some time trying to get a the client and backened to communicate to pass data between the two sources. For some reason, I was missing a key link, so I went back and created a simple set of axios requests on the client; I dislike doing this as it's not  as secure, but it's faster. Plus, the backend is now set up for some API construction in the near future.
2. There are many things I would like to discuss on Monday regarding this; I gave it the best I could this evening in the time I had alloted. Namely I'd like to discuss:
    - deisgn choices I would make
    - tweaking the API to get rid of the wonkiness of the delete fucntionality and the need to click buttons more than once to see the results of the first click (something to do with setting state I think)
    - fixing the client-side communication with the backend server
    - Overall imporvements for the site. There are certainly rough edges but I am excited for being guided through improvements!

 I stopped coding at 20:02 EST on 5/20/22, the time afterwards was spent updating the README and zipping the files. Thank you for your understanding!
