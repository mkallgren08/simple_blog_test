# React Template with Express Server and MongoDB Integration
### Author: Michael Kallgren

This is a basic 'template' file for creating a full-stack MERN application. I say 'template' because it is its own working app, but it is a simple one whose parts are fairly easy to convert and  expand.

## Use 
To use this template, perform the following steps:

1. Make sure you have `yarn` or `npm` installed on your machine
2. Copy this project to the directory of your choice (renaming it what you want)
3. Run `npm run i-stack` to install the node packages in both the root and client directories.
    - If the installation is succesful, you should see a `node_modules` directory in both the project root directory AND one in the `client` directory
4. Run `yarn start` or `npm run start`. A new browser tab should open in your default web browser and redirect to the client port (localhost port 3000 by default) and a node server should start running on a different port (localhost port 3001 by default). Happy coding!
